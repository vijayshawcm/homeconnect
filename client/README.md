## 🧱 Component Structure

### Feature-based Architecture

We follow a feature-based architecture where each feature is self-contained with its own:

- Components
- Hooks
- State management
- Business logic

### Shared Components

Common UI components are built using ShadCN UI and are located in `src/components/ui/`. These include:

- Buttons
- Cards
- Inputs
- Labels
- Sheets
- Tooltips
- etc.

## 🎨 Styling

- Using Tailwind CSS for styling
- ShadCN UI components for consistent design
- Custom theme configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
- Global styles in `src/styles/`

## 🔒 State Management

- Global state managed with Zustand
- Feature-specific state contained within feature modules
- Authentication state in `src/store/userAuth.jsx`

## 📚 Development Guidelines

1. **Component Creation:**

   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Place shared components in `src/components/`
   - Place feature-specific components in their respective feature folders

2. **Styling:**

   - Use Tailwind CSS classes
   - Follow the project's color scheme and design system
   - Maintain dark mode compatibility (pending integration)

3. **State Management:**

   - Use local state for component-specific state
   - Use Zustand for global state
   - Keep state logic close to where it's used

4. **Code Style:**

   - Follow ESLint configuration
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Write comments for complex logic

5. **Performance:**
   - Optimize images and assets (file format, resizing, compression, etc)
